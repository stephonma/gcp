QUESTION 2
Your company has decided to build a backup replica of their on-premises user authentication PostgreSQL database on Google Cloud Platform. The database is 4 TB, and large updates are frequent. Replication requires private address space communication. Which networking approach should you use? A. Google Cloud Dedicated Interconnect B. Google Cloud VPN connected to the data center network C. A NAT and TLS translation gateway installed on-premises D. A Google Compute Engine instance with a VPN server installed connected to the data center network
Answer: A
Explanation:
Google Cloud Dedicated Interconnect provides direct physical connections and RFC 1918 communication between your on-premises network and Google’s network. Dedicated Interconnect enables you to transfer large amounts of data between networks, which can be more cost effective than purchasing additional bandwidth over the public Internet or using VPN tunnels.
Benefits:
Traffic between your on-premises network and your VPC network doesn't traverse the public Internet. Traffic traverses a dedicated connection with fewer hops, meaning there are less points of failure where traffic might get dropped or disrupted.
Your VPC network's internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses are directly accessible from your on-premises network. You don't need to use a NAT device or VPN tunnel to reach internal IP addresses. Currently, you can only reach internal IP addresses over a dedicated connection. To reach Google external IP addresses, you must use a separate connection.
You can scale your connection to Google based on your needs. Connection capacity is delivered over one or more 10 Gbps Ethernet connections, with a maximum of eight connections (80 Gbps total per interconnect).
The cost of egress traffic from your VPC network to your on-premises network is reduced. A dedicated connection is generally the least expensive method if you have a high-volume of traffic to and from Google’s network.

QUESTION 4
Your company's test suite is a custom C++ application that runs tests throughout each day on Linux virtual machines. The full test suite takes several hours to complete, running on a limited number of on premises servers reserved for testing. Your company wants to move the testing infrastructure to the cloud, to reduce the amount of time it takes to fully test a change to the system, while changing the tests as little as possible. Which cloud infrastructure should you recommend? A. Google Compute Engine unmanaged instance groups and Network Load Balancer B. Google Compute Engine managed instance groups with auto-scaling C. Google Cloud Dataproc to run Apache Hadoop jobs to process each test D. Google App Engine with Google Stackdriver for logging
Answer: B
Explanation:
Google Compute Engine enables users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand. VMs can be launched from the standard images or custom images created by users.
Managed instance groups offer autoscaling capabilities that allow you to automatically add or remove instances from a managed instance group based on increases or decreases in load. Autoscaling helps your applications gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduces cost when the need for resources is lower.
Incorrect Answers:
B: There is no mention of incoming IP data traffic for the custom C++ applications.
C: Apache Hadoop is not fit for testing C++ applications. Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of datasets of big data using the MapReduce programming model.

QUESTION 5
Your company just finished a rapid lift and shift to Google Compute Engine for your compute needs. You have another 9 months to design and deploy a more cloud-native solution. Specifically, you want a system that is no-ops and auto-scaling. Which two compute products should you choose? Choose 2 answers A. Compute Engine with containers B. Google Container Engine with containers C. Google App Engine Standard Environment D. Compute Engine with custom instance types E. Compute Engine with managed instance groups
Answer: BC
Explanation:
B: With Container Engine, Google will automatically deploy your cluster for you, update, patch, secure the nodes.
Kubernetes Engine's cluster autoscaler automatically resizes clusters based on the demands of the workloads you want to run.
C: Solutions like Datastore, BigQuery, AppEngine, etc are truly NoOps.
App Engine by default scales the number of instances running up and down to match the load, thus providing consistent performance for your app at all times while minimizing idle instances and thus reducing cost.
Note: At a high level, NoOps means that there is no infrastructure to build out and manage during usage of the platform. Typically, the compromise you make with NoOps is that you lose control of the underlying infrastructure.

What should you do? 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
A. Create a shutdown script named k99.shutdown in the /etc/rc.6.d/ directory. B. Create a shutdown script registered as a xinetd service in Linux and configure a Stackdnver endpoint check to call the service. C. Create a shutdown script and use it as the value for a new metadata entry with the key shutdown-script in the Cloud Platform Console when you create the new virtual machine instance. D. Create a shutdown script, registered as a xinetd service in Linux, and use the gcloud compute instances add-metadata command to specify the service URL as the value for a new metadata entry with the key shutdown-script-url
Answer: C
Explanation:
Running Shutdown Scripts: Create and run shutdown scripts that execute commands right before an instance is terminated or restarted, on a best-effort basis. This is useful if you rely on automated scripts to start up and shut down instances, allowing instances time to clean up or perform tasks, such as exporting logs, or syncing with other systems.
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shutdownscript
To setup Shutdown Scripts, go to GCP console and follow the steps:

QUESTION 10
Your company wants to try out the cloud with low risk. They want to archive approximately 100 TB of their log data to the cloud and test the analytics features available to them there, while also retaining that data as a long-term disaster recovery backup. Which two steps should they take? Choose 2 answers A. Load logs into Google BigQuery. B. Load logs into Google Cloud SQL. C. Import logs into Google Stackdriver. D. Insert logs into Google Cloud Bigtable. E. Upload log files into Google Cloud Storage.
Answer: AE
Explanation:
A is correct because BigQuery is the fully managed cloud data warehouse for analytics and supports the analytics requirement.
B is not correct because Cloud SOL does not support the expected 100 TB Additionally, Cloud SQL is a relational database and not the best fit for time-series log data formats
C Is not correct because Stackdriver is optimized for monitoring, error reporting, and debugging instead of analytics queries.
D is not correct because Cloud Bigtable is optimized for read-write latency and analytics throughput not analytics querying and reporting.
E is correct because Cloud Storage provides the Coldline storage class to support long-term storage with infrequent access, which would support the long-term disaster recovery backup requirement.
QUESTION 11
You set up an autoscaling instance group to serve web traffic for an upcoming launch. After configuring the instance group as a backend service to an HTTP(S) load balancer, you notice that virtual machine (VM) instances are being terminated and re-launched every minute. The 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
instances do not have a public IP address. You have verified the appropriate web response is coming from each instance using the curl command. You want to ensure the backend is configured correctly. What should you do? A. Ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow source traffic on HTTP/HTTPS to reach the load balancer. B. Assign a public IP to each instance and configure a firewall rule to allow the load balancer to reach the instance public IP. C. Ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow load balancer health checks to reach the instances in the instance group. D. Create a tag on each instance with the name of the load balancer. Configure a firewall rule with the name of the load balancer as the source and the instance tag as the destination.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The best practice when configuration a health check is to check health and serve traffic on the same port. However, it is possible to perform health checks on one port, but serve traffic on another. If you do use two different ports, ensure that firewall rules and services running on instances are configured appropriately. If you run health checks and serve traffic on the same port, but decide to switch ports at some point, be sure to update both the backend service and the health check.
Backend services that do not have a valid global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked and will have no health status.

They have an n1- standard-8 virtual machine with 80 GB of SSD persistent disk.
What should they change to get better performance from this system? A. Increase the virtual machine's memory to 64 GB. B. Create a new virtual machine running PostgreSQL. C. Dynamically resize the SSD persistent disk to 500 GB. D. Migrate their performance metrics warehouse to BigQuery. E. Modify all of their batch jobs to use bulk inserts into the database.
Answer: C
Explanation:
A is not correct because increasing the memory size will not improve persistent disk throughput.
B is not correct because the DB administration team is requesting help with their MySQL instance Migration to a different product should not be the solution when other optimization techniques can still be applied first.
C is correct because persistent disk performance is based on the total persistent disk capacity attached to an instance and the number of vCPUs that the Instance has Incrementing the persistent disk capacity will increment ns throughput and IOPS, which In turn improve the performance of MySQL.
D is not correct because the DB administration team is requesting help with their MySQL instance Migration to a different product should not be the solution when other optimization techniques can still be applied first.

collection.
Answer: ABF
Explanation:
A (Correct answer) - Ensure that the load tests validate the performance of Cloud Bigtable.
At first thought, it seems Bigtable is managed service seamlessly scaling, there is no need to load test it. But you probably already know, there are many factors impacting the Bigtable performance. The common one of them, poorly designed table structure.
With poorly performed BigTable, the cluster would continue to scale, add more and more nodes, as the load increasing, cost more and more. Not matter how good is the cluster managed, this is exact situation that needs to prevent. In fact, tests validate the performance of Cloud Bigtable is one of the most important testing goals for BigTable performance.
B (Correct answer) - Create a separate Google Cloud project to use for the load-testing environment.
This is a good practice for least privileges and separation of responsibilities.
C - Schedule the load-testing tool to regularly run against the production environment.
You should not do load testing RGULARLY against production environment; In fact, somebody has suggested Load test in production should avoid entirely.
D - Ensure all third-party systems your services used are capable of handling high load
This is out of scope - it's beyond your control. You may test them, but you cannot control them. If you have doubts the third-party dependencies causing the overall performance issue, you may use integration test to identify and isolate them. This should not be your focus.
E - Instrument the production services to record every transaction for replay by the load-testing tool.
This would be way too much: not only the detailed instrumentation may impact the production performance, it's also possible the instrumentation itself distorts the test results - remember, Bigtable is for multiple terabyte or even petabyte NoSQL database for high throughput with low latency read and write.
F (Correct answer) - Instrument the load-testing tool and the target services with detailed logging and metrics collection.
This is normal requirement and practice for load testing to collect testing results with detailed measurable metric and historical logs otherwise load testing would be meaningless

The application reliability team at your company has added a debug feature to their backend service to send all server events to Google Cloud Storage for eventual analysis. The event records are at least 50 KB and at most 15 MB and are expected to peak at 3,000 events per second. You want to minimize data loss.
Which process should you implement? A. Append metadata to file body. Compress individual files. Name files with serverName-Timestamp. Create a new bucket if bucket is older than 1 hour and save individual files to the new bucket. Otherwise, save files to existing bucket B. Batch every 10,000 events with a single manifest file for metadata. Compress event files and manifest file into a single archive file. Name files using serverName-EventSequence. Create a new bucket if bucket is older than 1 day and save the single archive file to the new bucket. Otherwise, save the single archive file to existing bucket. C. Compress individual files. Name files with serverName-EventSequence. Save files to one bucket Set custom metadata headers for each object after saving. D. Append metadata to file body. Compress individual files. Name files with a random prefix pattern. Save files to one bucket
Answer: D
Explanation:
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-rate
Use a naming convention that distributes load evenly across key ranges
Auto-scaling of an index range can be slowed when using sequential names, such as object keys based on a sequence of numbers or timestamp. This occurs because requests are constantly shifting to a new index range, making redistributing the load harder and less effective.
In order to maintain a high request rate, avoid using sequential names. Using completely random object names will give you the best load distribution.

QUESTION 23
One of the developers on your team deployed their application In Google Container Engine with the Dockerfile below. They report that their application deployments are taking too long.
You want to optimize this Dockerfile for faster deployment times without adversely affecting the app's functionality. Which two actions should you take? Choose 2 answers A. Remove Python after running pip. B. Remove dependencies from requirements.txt. C. Use a slimmed-down base image like Alpine linux. D. Use larger machine types for your Google Container Engine node pools. E. Copy the source after the package dependencies (Python and pip) are installed.
Answer: CE
Explanation:
The speed of deployment can be changed by limiting the size of the uploaded app, limiting the complexity of the build necessary in the Dockerfile, if present, and by ensuring a fast and reliable internet connection.
Note: Alpine Linux is built around musl libc and busybox. This makes it smaller and more resource efficient than traditional GNU/Linux distributions. A container requires no more than 8 MB and a minimal installation to disk requires around 130 MB of storage. Not only do you get a fully-fledged Linux environment but a large selection of packages from the repository.

CEO Statement
Our last successful game did not scale well with our previous cloud provider, resuming in lower user adoption and affecting the game's reputation. Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game, as well as other metrics that provide deeper insight into usage patterns so we can adapt the gams to target users.
CTO Statement
Our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.
CFO Statement
We are not capturing enough user demographic data usage metrics, and other KPIs. As a result, we do not engage the right users. We are not confident that our marketing is targeting the right users, and we are not selling enough premium Blast-Ups inside the games, which dramatically impacts our revenue.

QUESTION 57
Case Study: 2 - TerramEarth Case Study
Company Overview
TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: About 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
Company Background
TerramEarth formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers' needs change. For the past 20 years trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
Solution Concept
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules. Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second, with 22 hours of operation per day. TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
Existing Technical Environment 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
TerramEarth's existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
Business Requirements
- Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory
- Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment IP better position new products and services.
- Have the ability to partner with different companies-especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business-to create compelling joint offerings for their customers
CEO Statement
We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers' yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
CTO Statement
Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process with our ability to build better vehicles for tower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I'm concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn't take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. TerramEarth's CTO wants to use the raw data from connected vehicles to help identify approximately when a vehicle in the field will have a catastrophic failure.

D. Vehicles continue to write data using the existing system (FTP).
Answer: C
Explanation:
Streamed data is available for real-time analysis within a few seconds of the first streaming insertion into a table.
Instead of using a job to load data into BigQuery, you can choose to stream your data into BigQuery one record at a time by using the tabledata().insertAll() method. This approach enables querying data without the delay of running a load job.

For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study.
You analyzed TerramEarth's business requirement to reduce downtime, and found that they can achieve a majority of time saving by reducing customers' wait time for parts.
You decided to focus on reduction of the 3 weeks aggregate reporting time.
Which modifications to the company's processes should you recommend? A. Migrate from CSV to binary format, migrate from FTP to SFTP transport, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics. B. Migrate from FTP to streaming transport, migrate from CSV to binary format, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics. C. Increase fleet cellular connectivity to 80%, migrate from FTP to streaming transport, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics. D. Migrate from FTP to SFTP transport, develop machine learning analysis of metrics, and increase dealer local inventory by a fixed factor.
Answer: C
Explanation:
B - Migrate from FTP to streaming transport, migrate from CSV to binary format, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics. 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
If no cellular connection, then it cannot do streaming; CVS to binary does not necessary reduce the size (compress does).
C (Correct answer) - Increase fleet cellular connectivity to 80%, migrate from FTP to streaming transport, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics.
TerramEarth Existing Technical Environment New Solution: 80% going to streaming; 20% goes to Batch; No FTP
GCP offers many ways to connect to PubSub and GCS such as IOT Type, rich client library, as well as gsutil for reliable, parallel, resumable upload data
By increase fleet cellular connectivity to 80%, migrating from FTP to streaming transport, and the rest of 20% batch users for Cloud storage upload instead of FTP, majority of bottlenecked areas are covered and resolved.
A and D can be eliminated for "Migrate from FTP to SFTP transport" since SFTP doesn't provide speed advantage over FTP nor the better solution with streaming.

These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
Business Requirements
- Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory
- Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment IP better position new products and services.
- Have the ability to partner with different companies-especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business-to create compelling joint offerings for their customers
CEO Statement
We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services,

such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers' yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
CTO Statement
Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process with our ability to build better vehicles for tower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I'm concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn't take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. To speed up data retrieval, more vehicles will be upgraded to cellular connections and be able to transmit data to the ETL process. The current FTP process is error-prone and restarts the data transfer from the start of the file when connections fail, which happens often. You want to improve the reliability of the solution and minimize data transfer time on the cellular connections. What should you do? A. Use one Google Container Engine cluster of FTP servers. Save the data to a Multi-Regional bucket. Run the ETL process using data in the bucket. B. Use multiple Google Container Engine clusters running FTP servers located in different regions. Save the data to Multi-Regional buckets in us, eu, and asia. Run the ETL process using the data in the bucket. C. Directly transfer the files to different Google Cloud Multi-Regional Storage bucket locations in us, eu, and asia using Google APIs over HTTP(S). Run the ETL process using the data in the bucket. D. Directly transfer the files to a different Google Cloud Regional Storage bucket location in us, eu, and asia using Google APIs over HTTP(S). Run the ETL process to retrieve the data from each Regional bucket.

B. Push the telemetry data in Real-time to a streaming dataflow job that compresses the data, and store it in Google BigQuery. C. Push the telemetry data in real-time to a streaming dataflow job that compresses the data, and store it in Cloud Bigtable. D. Have the vehicle's computer compress the data in hourly snapshots, a Store it in a GCS Coldline bucket.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Answer should be B - Why would you collect data in Coldline when the purpose is to collect data to analysis down the line and cost wise it should be similar to store such large volume in BQ instead of COldline given the Data access cost involved. ML can be directly done on BQ instead of pulling this data from Coldline into another DB and then applying ML algos on the data which will be more expensive to achieve

The JencoMart security team requires that all Google Cloud Platform infrastructure is deployed using a least privilege model with separation of duties for administration between production and development resources. What Google domain and project structure should you recommend? A. Create two G Suite accounts to manage users: one for development/test/staging and one for production. Each account should contain one project for every application. B. Create two G Suite accounts to manage users: one with a single project for all development applications and one with a single project for all production applications.
淘宝店: 国际认证大师

C. Create a single G Suite account to manage users with each stage of each application in its own project. D. Create a single G Suite account to manage users with one project for the development/test/staging environment and one project for the production environment.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Note: The principle of least privilege and separation of duties are concepts that, although semantically different, are intrinsically related from the standpoint of security. The intent behind both is to prevent people from having higher privilege levels than they actually need
Principle of Least Privilege: Users should only have the least amount of privileges required to perform their job and no more. This reduces authorization exploitation by limiting access to resources such as targets, jobs, or monitoring templates for which they are not authorized.
Separation of Duties: Beyond limiting user privilege level, you also limit user duties, or the specific jobs they can perform. No user should be given responsibility for more than one related function. This limits the ability of a user to perform a malicious action and then cover up that action.

A few days after JencoMart migrates the user credentials database to Google Cloud Platform and shuts down the old server, the new database server stops responding to SSH connections. It is still serving database requests to the application servers correctly. What three steps should you take to diagnose the problem? Choose 3 answers A. Delete the virtual machine (VM) and disks and create a new one. B. Delete the instance, attach the disk to a new VM, and investigate. C. Take a snapshot of the disk and connect to a new machine to investigate. D. Check inbound firewall rules for the network the machine is connected to. E. Connect the machine to another network with very simple firewall rules and investigate. F. Print the Serial Console output for the instance for troubleshooting, activate the interactive console, and investigate.
Answer: CDF
Explanation:
D: Handling "Unable to connect on port 22" error message
Possible causes include:
There is no firewall rule allowing SSH access on the port. SSH access on port 22 is enabled on all Compute Engine instances by default. If you have disabled access, SSH from the Browser will not work. If you run sshd on a port other than 22, you need to enable the access to that port with a custom firewall rule.
The firewall rule allowing SSH access is enabled, but is not configured to allow connections from GCP Console services. Source IP addresses for browser-based SSH sessions are dynamically allocated by GCP Console and can vary from session to session.
F: Handling "Could not connect, retrying..." error
You can verify that the daemon is running by navigating to the serial console output page and looking for output lines prefixed with the accounts-from-metadata: string. If you are using a standard image but you do not see these output prefixes in the serial console output, the daemon might be stopped. Reboot the instance to restart the daemon.

For this question, refer to the JencoMart case study.
JencoMart has decided to migrate user profile storage to Google Cloud Datastore and the application servers to Google Compute Engine (GCE). During the migration, the existing infrastructure will need access to Datastore to upload the data. What service account key-management strategy should you recommend? A. Provision service account keys for the on-premises infrastructure and for the GCE virtual machines (VMs). B. Authenticate the on-premises infrastructure with a user account and provision service account keys for the VMs. C. Provision service account keys for the on-premises infrastructure and use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) managed keys for the VMs D. Deploy a custom authentication service on GCE/Google Container Engine (GKE) for the on- premises infrastructure and use GCP managed keys for the VMs.
Answer: A
Explanation:
A) (correct answer) This addresses both of data migration and application server migration properly.
"Provision service account keys for the on-premises infrastructure": For code running on systems outside Google, you cannot use GCP-managed keys. You need to create Service account for it and provision User-managed keys. These keys are created, downloadable, and managed by users - This is solution for on-premises access to GCP datastore during migration
"use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) managed keys for the VMs" - this is solution for Application server migration since there is no external access to GCP is required during the migration.
Answer B is incorrect: First, the applications running on-premises to access GCP Datastore assume the identity of the service account to call Google APIs, so that the users aren't directly involved. 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
Secondly, for the application server migration to GCP VMs, you can use GCP managed keys for the VMs. It's simple and effective. There is no need to provision and manage keys (User-managed keys) by yourself for the VMs.
GCP-managed keys are used by Cloud Platform services such as App Engine and Compute Engine. These keys cannot be downloaded. Google will keep the keys and automatically rotate them on an approximately weekly basis.
C) is incorrect in the solution for on-premises access to GCP Datastore - This is possible options that might require more setup than worthwhile for the requirements.
D) is incorrect for reason of application server migration: you can use GCP managed keys for the VMs. It's simple and effective. There is no need to provision and manage keys (User-managed keys) by yourself for the application VMs

Case Study: 4 - Dress4Win case study
Company Overview
Dress4win is a web-based company that helps their users organize and manage their personal wardrobe using a website and mobile application. The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a freemium app model.
Company Background
Dress4win's application has grown from a few servers in the founder's garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application's rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company's desire to innovate faster, Dress4win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.
Solution Concept
For the first phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4win is considering moving their development and test environments. They are also considering building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them.
Existing Technical Environment
The Dress4win application is served out of a single data center location.
Databases:
MySQL - user data, inventory, static data
Redis - metadata, social graph, caching
Application servers:
Tomcat - Java micro-services
Nginx - static content
Apache Beam - Batch processing
Storage appliances:

Use managed services whenever possible.
Encrypt data on the wire and at rest.
Support multiple VPN connections between the production data center and cloud environment.
CEO Statement
Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a new competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and freeing them to focus on developing better features.
CTO Statement
We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
CFO Statement
Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current model.
For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study.
At Dress4Win, an operations engineer wants to create a tow-cost solution to remotely archive copies of database backup files. The database files are compressed tar files stored in their current data center.
How should he proceed? A. Create a cron script using gsutil to copy the files to a Coldline Storage bucket. B. Create a cron script using gsutil to copy the files to a Regional Storage bucket. C. Create a Cloud Storage Transfer Service Job to copy the files to a Coldline Storage bucket. D. Create a Cloud Storage Transfer Service job to copy the files to a Regional Storage bucket.

For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study.
Dress4Win has end-to-end tests covering 100% of their endpoints. They want to ensure that the move to the cloud does not introduce any new bugs.
Which additional testing methods should the developers employ to prevent an outage? A. They should enable Google Stackdriver Debugger on the application code to show errors in the code. B. They should add additional unit tests and production scale load tests on their cloud staging environment. C. They should run the end-to-end tests in the cloud staging environment to determine if the code is working as intended. D. They should add canary tests so developers can measure how much of an impact the new release causes to latency.
Answer: B
Explanation:
B is correct answer because the question asks about additional methods to prevent an outage.
If they have already 100% coverage than they are smart enough to run those test on new platform as C describes.

Your organization wants to control IAM policies for different departments independently, but centrally.
Which approach should you take? A. Multiple Organizations with multiple Folders B. Multiple Organizations, one for each department C. A single Organization with Folders for each department D. A single Organization with multiple projects, each with a central owner
Answer: C
Explanation:
Folders are nodes in the Cloud Platform Resource Hierarchy. A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of GCP resources. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies. While a folder can contain multiple folders or resources, a given folder or resource can have exactly one parent.

QUESTION 91
Case Study: 6 - TerramEarth
Company Overview
TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries. About 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
Solution Concept
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.
Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
Existing Technical Environment
TerramEarth’s existing architecture is composed of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S. west coast based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
Business Requirements
Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week.
Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
Have the ability to partner with different companies – especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business – to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.
Technical Requirements
Expand beyond a single datacenter to decrease latency to the American Midwest and east coast.
Create a backup strategy.
Increase security of data transfer from equipment to the datacenter.
Improve data in the data warehouse.
Use customer and equipment data to anticipate customer needs.

- RedHat Linux
- 64 CPUs
- 128 GB of RAM
- 4x 6TB HDD in RAID 0
Executive Statement
Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I’m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.

Executive Statement
Our last successful game did not scale well with our previous cloud provider, resulting in lower user adoption and affecting the game’s reputation. Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game, as well as other metrics that provide deeper insight into usage patterns so we can adapt the game to target users. Additionally, our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.
For this question, refer to the Mountkirk Games case study. You need to analyze and define the technical architecture for the database workloads for your company, Mountkirk Games. Considering the business and technical requirements, what should you do? A. Use Cloud SQL for time series data, and use Cloud Bigtable for historical data queries. B. Use Cloud SQL to replace MySQL, and use Cloud Spanner for historical data queries. C. Use Cloud Bigtable to replace MySQL, and use BigQuery for historical data queries. D.

QUESTION 99
Case Study: 7 - Mountkirk Games
Company Overview
Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games for mobile platforms. They build all of their games using some server-side integration. Historically, they have used cloud providers to lease physical servers.
Due to the unexpected popularity of some of their games, they have had problems scaling their global audience, application servers, MySQL databases, and analytics tools.
Their current model is to write game statistics to files and send them through an ETL tool that loads them into a centralized MySQL database for reporting.
Solution Concept
Mountkirk Games is building a new game, which they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game’s backend on Google Compute Engine so they can capture streaming metrics, run intensive analytics, and take advantage of its autoscaling server environment and integrate with a managed NoSQL database.

Case Study: 7 - Mountkirk Games
Company Overview 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games for mobile platforms. They build all of their games using some server-side integration. Historically, they have used cloud providers to lease physical servers.
Due to the unexpected popularity of some of their games, they have had problems scaling their global audience, application servers, MySQL databases, and analytics tools.
Their current model is to write game statistics to files and send them through an ETL tool that loads them into a centralized MySQL database for reporting.
Solution Concept
Mountkirk Games is building a new game, which they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the game’s backend on Google Compute Engine so they can capture streaming metrics, run intensive analytics, and take advantage of its autoscaling server environment and integrate with a managed NoSQL database.
Business Requirements
Increase to a global footprint.
Improve uptime – downtime is loss of players.
Increase efficiency of the cloud resources we use.
Reduce latency to all customers.
Technical Requirements
Requirements for Game Backend Platform
Dynamically scale up or down based on game activity.
Connect to a transactional database service to manage user profiles and game state.
Store game activity in a timeseries database service for future analysis.
As the system scales, ensure that data is not lost due to processing backlogs.
Run hardened Linux distro.
Requirements for Game Analytics Platform
Dynamically scale up or down based on game activity
Process incoming data on the fly directly from the game servers
Process data that arrives late because of slow mobile networks
Allow queries to access at least 10 TB of historical data
Process files that are regularly uploaded by users’ mobile devices
Executive Statement
Our last successful game did not scale well with our previous cloud provider, resulting in lower user adoption and affecting the game’s reputation. Our investors want more key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the speed and stability of the game, as well as other metrics that provide deeper insight into usage patterns so we can adapt the game to target users. Additionally, our current technology stack cannot provide the scale we need, so we want to replace MySQL and move to an environment that provides autoscaling, low latency load balancing, and frees us up from managing physical servers.
For this question, refer to the Mountkirk Games case study. You are in charge of the new Game Backend Platform architecture. The game communicates with the backend over a REST API.
You want to follow Google-recommended practices. How should you design the backend? A. Create an instance template for the backend. For every region, deploy it on a multi-zone managed instance group. Use an L4 load balancer. B. Create an instance template for the backend. For every region, deploy it on a single-zone managed instance group. Use an L4 load balancer.

Case Study: 2 - TerramEarth Case Study
Company Overview
TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: About 80% of their business is from mining and 20% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.
Company Background
TerramEarth formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.
TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers' needs change. For the past 20 years trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.
Solution Concept
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules. Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second, with 22 hours of operation per day. TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
Existing Technical Environment
TerramEarth's existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
Business Requirements
- Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
- Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment IP better position new products and services.
- Have the ability to partner with different companies-especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business-to create compelling joint offerings for their customers
CEO Statement
We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers' yields by 25%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50% of our revenues by 2020.
CTO Statement
Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process with our ability to build better vehicles for tower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I'm concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn't take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations.
Your agricultural division is experimenting with fully autonomous vehicles. You want your architecture to promote strong security during vehicle operation.
Which two architectures should you consider? (Choose two.) A. Treat every micro service call between modules on the vehicle as untrusted. B. Require IPv6 for connectivity to ensure a secure address space. C. Use a trusted platform module (TPM) and verify firmware and binaries on boot. D. Use a functional programming language to isolate code execution cycles. E. Use multiple connectivity subsystems for redundancy. F. Enclose the vehicle's drive electronics in a Faraday cage to isolate chips.

The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules. 淘宝店: 国际认证大师
微信: ANYPASS
Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.
Existing Technical Environment
TerramEarth’s existing architecture is composed of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S. west coast based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.
Business Requirements
Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week.
Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services
Have the ability to partner with different companies – especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business – to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.
Technical Requirements
Expand beyond a single datacenter to decrease latency to the American Midwest and east coast.
Create a backup strategy.
Increase security of data transfer from equipment to the datacenter.
Improve data in the data warehouse.
Use customer and equipment data to anticipate customer needs.

Case Study: 4 - Dress4Win
Company Overview
Dress4win is a web-based company that helps their users organize and manage their personal wardrobe using a website and mobile application. The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a freemium app model.
Company Background
Dress4win's application has grown from a few servers in the founder's garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application's rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company's desire to innovate faster, Dress4win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud.
Solution Concept
For the first phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4win is considering moving their development and test environments. They are also considering building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them.
Existing Technical Environment
The Dress4win application is served out of a single data center location.
Databases:
MySQL - user data, inventory, static data
Redis - metadata, social graph, caching
Application servers:

Use managed services whenever possible.
Encrypt data on the wire and at rest.
Support multiple VPN connections between the production data center and cloud environment.
CEO Statement
Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a new competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and freeing them to focus on developing better features.
CTO Statement
We have invested heavily in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
CFO Statement
Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current model.
Dress4Win has end-to-end tests covering 100% of their endpoints.
They want to ensure that the move to the cloud does not introduce any new bugs.
Which additional testing methods should the developers employ to prevent an outage? A. They should enable Google Stackdriver Debugger on the application code to show errors in the code. B. They should add additional unit tests and production scale load tests on their cloud staging environment. C. They should run the end-to-end tests in the cloud staging environment to determine if the code is working as intended. D. They should add canary tests so developers can measure how much of an impact the new release causes to latency.

Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better features. Our traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle.
Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years for a public cloud strategy achieves a cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model.
